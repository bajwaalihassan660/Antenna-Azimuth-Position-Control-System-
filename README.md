# Antenna-Azimuth-Position-Control-System-
Antenna Azimuth Position Control System using matlab 
I designed an antenna azimuth position control system using MATLAB. This project involved creating a control system to accurately position an antenna based on azimuth angles. I used MATLAB to model and simulate the control system, analyzing its performance using Bode plots. Through this project, I enhanced my understanding of control systems, system dynamics, and the use of MATLAB for modeling and simulation.
